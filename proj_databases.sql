Content Management Systems (CMS) can do this for your business easily and efficiently. There are several commercial systems available, but customizing one for your specific needs is usually necessary based on your data. Creating Content Management Systems in Java teaches you how to develop an open source CMS from scratch using XML as the storage mechanism, XSLT as the presentation layer, and Java and JSPs & Servlets to realize the multi-tiered architecture. The book also covers data modeling in XML and the use of XSLT as a presentation vehicle for custom XML formats. Creating Content Management Systems in Java is written for Web and software developers (specifically Java developers) who wish to learn more about the field of content management. The book provides a practical, applied perspective with complete demonstrations using code to show you how a solution or feature can be implemented. Throughout the book you will work through the development of a complete, open source, working CMS example, beginning with the conceptual ideas of content management. From there you''ll dive into the exploration of practical design solutions, and then move into the final implementations in each tier of the software that becomes the CMS. To benefit the most from this book, you should already know the Java programming language and have a basic understanding of the Web. You do not need to know XML, XSLT, CSS, or XHTML because these topics are covered thoroughly, although a basic understanding will be helpful. So, if you need to learn more about CMS development, this is the book for you.', 'Softbound', 0),

Many businesses and educational institutions as well as individuals have begun using UNIX/Linux because of its power, stability, reliability, and flexibility. With this increase in users, as well as potential users, comes the strong need for a complete and comprehensive text that will easily guide Windows users in the conversion to UNIX. Introduction to UNIX provides the necessary background and knowledge to become familiar with the UNIX/Linux environment and understand how to use its potential. For educational institutions, the book is designed to present a broad and thorough UNIX background for courses taken by students in computer, business, engineering, mathematics, education, and other majors. The book is also intended to assist the individual who wishes to learn UNIX independently by supplying them with all of the basic information on how to use UNIX and its functions. Anyone with any version of UNIX will find this book helpful as many of the concepts covered are universal and apply to all UNIX/Linux systems. The book explores many significant topics including creating and editing files as well as generating and developing professional-looking typeset documents. In addition, the book also covers programming related topics such as writing code to process files and provide a convenient way for users to accomplish tasks and how to build, run, debug, measure, and analyze performance of C++ programs. Written in an easy-to-follow manner, Introduction to UNIX is the essential guide for the student looking to learn more about the UNIX system or the individual who wants to make the transition to UNIX.', 'Softbound', 0),
